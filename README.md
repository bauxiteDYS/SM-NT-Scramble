# SM-NT-Scramble
Sourcemod plugin for Neotokyo that scrambles teams for PUGs etc  
Use !scramble to randomise players on team.  
It will scramble players on teams and ignore Spec team unless Spec team has more players, in which case it will randomly place them the Specs on to teams while ignoring the other teams.
